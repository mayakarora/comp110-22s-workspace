When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it. Identifying new data sources can unlock improvements!"

These concepts would have to be ones that the instructors feel students should have a good understanding of just by watching the videos/attending class. Data could also be collected on how well a student feels they apply these concepts in the exercises or if they are unable to make the connections between concepts and applications. Both of these could provide insight on whether students might benefit from a more structured guide of the concepts."

    "### Part 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data, the class already has high rates of high interest levels. Based on the fact that the number of students considered to have a `low-interest,` or rating their interest as a `1` or `2`, is only `14 students`, so the course does not need to work hard to improve that aspect. Additionally, the number of students who rated their interest as `medium,` or as a `3`, `4`, or `5`, was `169 students`. Therefore, the majority of students consider themselves to have a `high interest,` or a rating of a `6` or `7`, in the class, with `437 students` in this category. The graph provides an appropriate visual for this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most students seem to have at least a mild interest in the class, it seems like there is not much that should change. However, if there is a desire to move some of the `medium interest` students to `high interest,` this idea could be further explored with more data. Specifically, while doing the survey, if students selected an option that was `3`, `4`, or `5`, there could be questions designed to assess what would make this class highly interesting for them. This could include questions such as, `Does this class lack a specific component that would make it highly interesting for you?` or `Would the ability to personalize more components of your exercises increase your interest in them?` \n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to students who selected `1` or `2`, there could be specific questions asking them to elaborate. This could be in the form of, `Is there any way this class could be more interesting for you?` or `Are there significant barriers to you having a high interest in this class?` An analysis of those who are highly interested would be a waste of resources, so I think targeting those who have room to improve would be more useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is if these changes would impact those with a high interest already. Additionally, some more things to explore is confounders between interest levels. Logically, it would make sense that more computer science majors are interested in a computer science class. So, would catering to students who are non-computer-science majors negatively impact those majoring in it? That is why I think it is crucial to understand where the disinterest or mild interest originates because a simple dislike of the material can not be addressed. However, a dislike of the way the topics are applied or some specific content can be addressed.\n"
